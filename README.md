## Recommendations 🌱
- Explore the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide) to learn more about its capabilities.
- Tailor the Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js` to match your design needs.
- Keep your code neat and tidy with ESLint and Prettier.
- Customize components to your liking. This project uses [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/) by default::
    - Customize the theme of the project with your own colors as explained in[this guide](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/theming.html) . You can also use the [theme builder](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/themes.html)
    - This template includes all shadcn components updated to the current date. Feel free to add or remove components as needed. Simply manage the component's folder located at `components/ui/[COMPONENT_NAME]`
- Avoid manual imports for components. In Nuxt 3, components are automatically imported globally by default. This feature is recommended for use
- Use the subfix ```.nuxt.test``` to your tests, this would inject the test automatically with the nuxt context environment
